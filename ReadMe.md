## Comparison: Manual Product Module vs Scaffolded Module

| Criteria | Manual Product Module (Day 1–2) | Scaffolded Module (Day 3) |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Development Effort** | Requires writing controllers, views, and logic manually. More coding work. | Most code is auto-generated. Minimal manual effort needed. |
| **Speed of Development** | Slower because each file and feature is built from scratch. | Very fast. CRUD functionality is created in seconds using scaffolding. |
| **Code Readability** | Depends on developer style. Can vary in structure and formatting. | Follows a consistent, standard MVC structure, making it easier to understand. |
| **Maintainability** | Harder to maintain if code is inconsistent or poorly structured. | Easier to maintain because of organized and predictable code patterns. |
| **Use Cases** | Best for custom UI, complex business logic, or unique features. | Best for standard CRUD applications like admin panels and data management systems. |

### Conclusion
Manual development offers flexibility and customization, while scaffolding improves speed, structure, and maintainability. Both approaches are useful depending on project requirements.
